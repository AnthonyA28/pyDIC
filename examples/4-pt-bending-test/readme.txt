Welcome to the 4 point bending test example !

This example shows how to use pydic on a tensile test
to deduce Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio from a serie of pictures. Note that the source 
code is documented and detailed to allow a better understanding of pydic. 

The description.png file describe the tensile test.

To run the example, simply type in a terminal :
$ python ./main.py
